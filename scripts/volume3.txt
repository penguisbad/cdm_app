September 18, 2018
To the Reader:
This year’s updated Volume 3 of our 2019 TAG Cyber Security Annual is the result of our growing team of expert
researchers working each day – since last year’s report issuance – to identify, update, and maintain an impossibly-
long list of cyber security vendors. I’m proud of the amazing TAG Cyber team for their fine efforts, and I hope their
intense work saves you valuable time, effort, and money in your own source selection research. That’s been our goal
for Volume 3 since Day One: To assist, and to support you – the cyber security professional.
We hesitate to call this a fully-comprehensive work, simply because each day seems to bring several new cyber
security vendors to the market. The moment this document is pushed to our roughly 54 free-download sites in mid-
September of 2018, a dozen great new cyber security companies will have been born. So, we do our best to include
everything we can find. And we keep searching and pushing to include more and more cyber security companies to
our list. We do this for you, every day of every week.
Another great challenge is the day-to-day flurry of mergers, acquisitions, and yes – dissolutions of cyber security
companies that must be tracked. It’s a tricky process, because when two great companies combine, such as
AlienVault and AT&T, the decision must be made whether to keep both as separate entries, or to combine them into
one new one. In the end, it’s a total judgment call. Generally, we try to keep them separate for as long as security
professionals might continue to view them separately. But we don’t always get this right.
People ask me every day if this list is automated and I feel like I’m apologizing when I say no. We do not crawl
sites, and we do not launch botnets to find companies. We do it the old-fashioned way – with fingers to keyboard,
and with shoe leather to pavement. (We make sure manually, for example, that we are a super-set of the RSA
Conference vendor sponsors.) What this means is that when we list a company, a human being on our staff has
checked to make sure that a real company exists. We get this right – most of the time.
As we announce every year, if you are a cyber security vendor and you are not listed here, then please drop me an
email at eamoroso@tag-cyber.com. I will do my best to set up a brief discussion, and might even blog about you as
well. If you follow me on LinkedIn (Edward Amoroso) or Twitter (@hashtag_cyber), then you are already familiar
with these types of articles and the cadence for their issuance. We also have created hours and hours (and more
hours) of video interviews with cyber luminaries, which you can check out on our TAG Cyber YouTube Channel.
So, welcome to this 2019 TAG Cyber Security Annual – Volume 3. The listings are free as always, so we hope you
save barrels of money by not having to pay external researchers. Most of these fancy industry analyst companies
will charge you a small fortune for this type of information (when they are not too busy throwing darts at some
dumb quadrant). Use the money you save by not paying them, to buy pizza for your team – for the next decade.

evidence of data on the client device after a browsing session has
closed. Authentic8’s product called Silo is a disposable, secure
container for controlled access to web apps and content. The
product includes support for single sign-on, as well as
enforcement of security policies in a device independent manner.
The product is positioned for two primary user communities.
First, it is targeted for users of web apps, either inside an
enterprise or on some cloud service. Second, it is positioned for
web app developers who can publish their web app securely to
device owners. The product is disposable, in the sense that the
cloud-based virtual browser instance is discarded from the local
device after the browsing session has completed.

Products and Services
Bromium offers an advanced endpoint protection platform that
leverages endpoint CPU virtualization technology called micro-
virtualization to protect endpoints by seamlessly hardware
isolating the execution of untrusted content. Micro-virtualization
also enables tamper-proof monitoring of the endpoint. Endpoints
share forensic details of each attack in real-time before self-
remediating to eliminate the attack. The platform automatically
and continuously hunts for indications of each detected attack
across all endpoints and servers in real-time to detect breaches.
The solution automates the expensive and time-consuming task of
enterprise-wide protection, detection and response. When an
endpoint isolates and identifies malware in a micro-VM it alerts
in real-time. Alerts contain precise information that enable an
automated response: identifying the attack, and blocking access to
infected sites and C&C servers and searching for signs of the
breach across all endpoints. Bromium is deployed and managed
via one-click deployment. The solution includes policy
orchestration, and powerful threat analysis tools. It supports
Windows and Mac OSX endpoints.

History
The Clavister story begins with entrepreneur Peter Johansson, who had founded
an early Internet company, EnterNet Sweden HB in 1995. As it grew, the need
for more equipment became mission critical. Johansson had joined forces with,
John Vestberg, who, together with talented software engineer Mikael Olsson,
quickly set about solving the problem. Together, they’ve created a secure and
fast router. In fact, they were developing an actual product that could be offered
to the market, a device and code that could take on the security aspects of an
always on Internet connection. Clavister AB was born in 2001. By 2002 they’ve
launched their first physical appliance, a highly regarded firewall device that
performed well in test after test. By 2008 the first virtual gateway was released.
Soon Asian offices were added. The development of their own, proprietary
software – first cOS Core and later its cOS Stream solution – made the product
into an award winning leader in cybersecurity and digital threat deterrence.
Investment and growth have helped Clavister create an installed base of 20,000
customers and propelled it to be one of the few Swedish technology companies
to be listed on the NASDAQ OMX Nordic stock exchange.

CounterTack employs techniques such as enterprise-grade rootkit
software and deployed agents on endpoints reporting back to a
server to address malware infections. A novel implication of this
approach is that in-progress, on-going attacks might be taken over
by security teams as part of an active retaliation process – which
is, in fact, the definition of the firm’s name. These techniques are
wrapped in intelligence information from CounterTack’s
knowledge library into an effective cyber security suite.
CounterTack’s products are grouped as follows:
• CounterTack Sentinel – This involves an enterprise-
grade rootkit being installed on endpoint systems for the
purpose of threat monitoring, analysis, and intelligence-
based protection.
• CounterTack Scout – This involves agents being
embedded in endpoint systems that report back
information to a CounterTack Scout server for the
purpose of real-time analysis and more advanced cyber
security protections.
• Knowledge Library – This collection of so-called stateful
compromise indicators (SCIs) is used as the basis for
CounterTack’s cyber security intelligence capabilities.

enriches the data to create hypergranular risk profiles.
Feedzai’s machine learning then works to process events and
transactions in milliseconds and delivers explainable AI by
adding a human-readable semantic layer to the underlying
machine logic. The result is better fraud prevention,
streamlined operations, and improved customer experience.
Feedzai’s integrated development and test environment
instantaneously takes models from build to production all
while optimizing for machine learning features, so models are
both predictable and accurate to expected results. This allows
for organizations to proactively guard points of compromise.

measurement are typically burdensome and viewed as a hindrance
to risk management rather than an enabler. Dr. Bayuk has used
the FrameCyber framework in a variety of consulting and
teaching endeavors and encourages a community rather than a
proprietary approach to sharing knowledge of such tools and
techniques.

FrameCyber provides automation to ease compliance or
comparison tasks with respect to industry, regulatory, or custom
requirements. It allows issue and event collection in support of
governance activities in a enterprise-wide risk management
framework that includes mapping existing controls and metrics to
specific risks to help senior management understand the value of
cybersecurity management activities and support executive
decisions with respect to cybersecurity risk. FrameCyber offers
easy upload and download capabilities to take full advantage of
existing enterprise tools and techniques. It can therefore be used
as a primary GRC platform, or a supplement for necessary
features that may not yet be mature within the organization.
FrameCyber is offered as both in-house and SaaS. FrameCyber
includes functions to upload and download all aforementioned
data types to facilitate enterprise integration with existing
systems. Security features include enterprise, user, network, and
device authentication, role and group-based entitlements, and
field level auditing. FrameCyber also provides access to a
knowledge base and community for information sharing focused
on cybersecurity risk assessment, information assurance, risk
measurement, risk reporting, risk mitigation and risk remediation.
The company that produces FrameCyber, Decision Framework
Systems, also provides cybersecurity consulting, training, and
support for academic use of the FrameCyber SaaS platform.

and object level access control for any kind of data regardless of
the source application using a scheme called crypto labeling. The
N2K crypto labeling process burns the crypto label to any digital
object converting it into a trusted data object and the policy
decision point (PDP) and the policy enforcement point (PEP)
remain with the trusted data object permanently. N2K labels are
distributed to users (human or device) and are updated over the
network and enforced using real-time authorization policies
including label suspension and revocation. N2K is easy to use and
easy to manage. N2K has a SDK with APIs so that the crypto
labeling functionality can be integrated with any 3rd party
product or legacy security solution. N2K has no backdoors.

Cybercriminals are finding new ways to outsmart today’s security
defenses by updating and releasing new malware versions of their
code. Security tools that rely on Indicators of Compromise (IOC),
based on signatures, behavioral models or patterns, won’t catch
evasive malware that has not yet revealed itself. Thanks to
Minerva Labs’ Anti-Evasion Platform, companies can now
prevent the stealthiest of attacks. Minerva Anti-Evasion Platform
is a comprehensive endpoint solution that prevents attacks
through trickery and deception. Using deception Minerva Labs
will:
• Deceive the malware’s perception or reality, prior
to installation, to the point that it is certain to be in
such a hostile environment and aborts the attack
• Stop in-memory attacks on the fly by preventing
the code injection into legit processes
• Trick malware into believing the same malware is
already running on the target when it’s not
• Deceive non-evasive ransomware into believing it
has encrypted the files on an endpoint when in
reality it had not
Minerva enhances your defense ecosystem with threat
intelligence. Once an unknown attack is blocked, Minerva will
update other security tools with the new attack pattern, to find and
eradicate attacks faster.

OneID focuses on providing users with the ability to manage their
on-line identity without the use of passwords. This goal is
accomplished by combining digital signatures on user devices
with digital signatures on OneID servers. Specifically, public key
cryptographic keys are stored on the user’s browser, the OneID
cloud, and if desired, the user’s mobile device. When the user
tries to log into any OneID enabled site, digital signatures from a
combination of locations is sufficient to validate the user’s
reported identity. The OneID product is an integrated
authentication system that supports personal and enterprise
identity validation without the need for passwords. The solution
requires end users and websites to be OneID enabled, and
requires users to sign up to obtain OneID key information for the
browser on their computer and their mobile devices. A growing
number of websites are beginning to accept and support OneID
logins, as well as a growing number of users on the Internet.

Bruce Flitcroft, Founder and CEO of Tenfour is a leader in engineering IT
infrastructure solutions that are transforming business and technology
models so that organizations can innovate in the Digital Age. Flitcroft is
also Founder and CEO of Red Forge, the sister company of TenFour. He
previously ran AlphaNet.
History
Headquartered in Morristown, NJ, Tenfour was founded in 1998 as an IT
integrator, under the name Alliant Technologies. In 2012, based on years of
experience as well as significant R&D investment, the company began
building an IT infrastructure utility company designed with greater agility,
reliability and network security. TenFour, as it was rebranded in 2017, is
accelerating change in all industries, starting with commercial and then
expanding to government and regulated markets. TenFour solutions are
engineered by Red Forge, which develops software, systems and tools that
next generation service providers need to deliver services to enterprises that
will power their digital business.

(WAN), Local Area Network(LAN), DataCenter, Unified Communications
and Collaboration (UCC), Physical Infrastructure, Network Security, and
Internet of Things (IoT) solutions in an IT Infrastructure-as-a-service utility
model. It has taken all the core IT infrastructure that was previously
“uncloudable”—from routers, switches and firewalls to phones, WiFi,
cameras and IoT devices—and delivers them as a utility service. Just as
other utilities deliver per-unit pricing, TenFour’s IT infrastructure is
delivered in IT Units (ITUs) with embedded services including all the
design, implementation, monitoring, repair and administration of each unit.
This also includes foundational security features that are always present,
including Syslog for network infrastructure management, configuration
change management, IPsec VPN, 802.11X for wired and wireless LAN,
AAA, compliance reporting, among other features. TenFour’s additional
security features are integrated into the company’s reference architectures,
including access control policies, mobile device containment, network
admission control, on-premises firewalls, intrusion prevention, server local
firewalls, network embedded firewalls, IPAM, DNS services, DHCP,
Netflow security analysis, web security, malware protection, and data loss
prevention in the cloud, among other capabilities. TenFour’s IT
Infrastructure Utility service allows for delivery of security services
through devices at Layer Four and below through a managed interface for
use at the Application Layer. Through this IT Infrastructure Utility
managed interface, lower level security services such as DDOS protection
can interact with higher-level applications such as a SIEM. TenFour works
with leading technology vendors including Cisco and is a program member
with AT&T Partner Exchange.
